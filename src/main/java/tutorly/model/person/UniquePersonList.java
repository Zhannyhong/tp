/**
 * A list of persons that enforces uniqueness between its elements and does not allow nulls.
 * A person is considered unique by comparing using {@code Person#isSamePerson(Person)}. As such, adding and updating of
 * persons uses Person#isSamePerson(Person) for equality so as to ensure that the person being added or updated is
 * unique in terms of identity in the UniquePersonList. However, the removal of a person uses Person#equals(Object) so
 * as to ensure that the person with exactly the same fields will be removed.
 * <p>
 * Supports a minimal set of list operations.
